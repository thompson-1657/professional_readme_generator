## Description
---
A quality README is essential to every application. It is the piece of the puzzle that explains the what, the why and the how. A quality README should provide other developers with all of the information they need to interact with, use, understand, and even contribute to the application.

This is a command line application that takes in user input about their application and not only generates but formats a professional README file that the user can then incorporate into their project. It allows for a consistent README file format throughout the users repositories and saves on the time the user would have to spend to input all of this information manually for each and every application they create.

## Installation
---
To install the application clone the application from the repository. Once cloned 
```
run npm install 
```
in the terminal to install the npm package dependency,   [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application itself can then be run in the terminal by invoking 
```
node index.js
```
In the terminal the user can answer questions in the command line about their application. Once all questions are answered a custom professional readme file with the title of the project will be generated automatically.
